# MediDetect: Parkinsons-Disease Prediction

## 1. Introduction and Description

Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the central nervous system, particularly the motor system. Its most common early symptoms are tremors, stiffness, slow movement, and difficulty walking. As the disease progresses, non-motor symptoms such as cognitive and behavioral changes, depression, anxiety, and apathy may also develop.

Famous people who have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease include Ozzy Osbourne and Muhammad Ali.

Early detection and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease can be difficult because its symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions. This can lead to misdiagnosis and worsening of the condition. By providing a model that can predict Parkinson's disease based on user-provided attributes, we hope to improve the chances of early detection and effective treatment.

## 2. Dataset Used

The given dataset has 22 attributes, which will be used as input by the user. Our prediction model will then analyze these inputs to predict whether the person has Parkinson's Disorder or not.

## 5. Methodology:

In the first phase of developing the model, the data was cleaned and converted into a numerical format. This involved converting any categorical data and removing any null or missing values.

In the second phase, visualizations were created to better understand the dataset and provide insights for implementing the model.

In the third phase, a variety of methods were applied to the dataset to make predictions. These predictions were then averaged to produce a final result, based on the input provided by the user.

In the final phase, a user interface was developed and linked to the prediction model, allowing it to be deployed in Django.

## 8. Future Scope

It is a concerning fact that approximately 70% of cases of Parkinson's disease go unnoticed or are misdiagnosed. This is often due to a lack of knowledge about the disease and inadequate methods for detecting it. As the number of cases in younger people increases, it is becoming increasingly important to develop models that can quickly and accurately diagnose Parkinson's disease. Our model provides fast and reliable results, allowing users to obtain a diagnosis within minutes of inputting their information. This can help avoid misdiagnosis and unnecessary visits to the doctor.
